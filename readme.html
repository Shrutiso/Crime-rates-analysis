Overall Trend Analysis of the Crime Dataset
1. Time-Based Crime Trends
Most crimes occur during late evening hours (7 PM – 11 PM).

A steady rise in incidents begins from afternoon (3 PM onwards), peaking in the evening, then tapering off post-midnight.

Crimes happen less frequently in the early morning hours (1 AM – 5 AM).

2. Location & Area Patterns
The heatmap revealed that certain areas like Wilshire, Central, and Van Nuys have consistently higher numbers of serious crimes (level 1).

Crime seriousness levels vary geographically, indicating that some areas are more prone to minor vs. major offenses.

3. Victim Demographics
From the Victim Gender Distribution, males are more frequently victims than females overall.

The boxplot indicated that certain crimes (like shoplifting or burglary) tend to affect younger adults, while others like fraud or grand theft auto might span a broader age range.

The scatter plot of Victim Age vs. Time showed:

Teenagers and young adults (15–25) are often targeted during afternoons and evenings.

Older victims (60+) appear in fewer cases and tend to be affected earlier in the day.

4. Crime Types
Most reported crimes revolve around vehicle-related theft (stolen or burglary) and property crimes.

Crime descriptions such as ‘VEHICLE - STOLEN’, ‘BURGLARY FROM VEHICLE’, and ‘SHOPLIFTING’ are the top three.

These crimes suggest a trend of property-centric urban offenses.

5. Geographic Distribution & Relationships
Pairplots and scatter plots show slight clustering based on location coordinates (latitude and longitude), indicating some crimes are concentrated in specific city blocks.

Victim age doesn't significantly correlate with location, but clusters suggest urban core areas are more active in terms of crime.
